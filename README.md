# Introduction to Python and Gurobi

An introduction to basic Python concepts, and most of what is needed to have the full work flow in OR research in Python.
The course is not intended to giv an in-depth treatment, but should provide a solid starting point for self-learning.

This workshop is intended for 2 sessions of 2 hours each, with the first 2 hours (notebooks 1 & 2) focusing on python basics, and the latter 2 on using standard python modules.
Notebook 4 is directly intended for OR researchers; if your group has a different focus, e.g. machine learning, this session can be adapted to that purpose.
