# Introduction to Python (and Gurobi)

An introduction to basic Python concepts, and most of what is needed to have the full work flow in OR research in Python.
The course is not intended to give an in-depth treatment of all aspects of Python, but should provide a solid starting point for self-learning.
The course level assumes that the user has experience in some other programming language (e.g. MATLAB, Java), and is looking to learn Python.

This workshop is intended for 2 sessions of 2 hours each, with the first 2 hours (notebooks 1 & 2) focusing on python basics, and the latter 2 on using standard python modules.
Notebook 4 is directly intended for OR researchers; if your group has a different focus, e.g. machine learning, this session can be adapted to that purpose.

## Needed tools

**To run these tutorials** on **Windows or Macintosh**, I recommend an installation of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
On **Linux**, use the version of iPython/Jupyter from your package manager.

The tutorial is written for Python 3.X, and is organized as ipython notebooks. These will work in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) as well.

To run **session 4**, you will need an installation of [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer), along with a license. [Free Academic Licenses](https://user.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic) are available for academic users.
